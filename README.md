### Badges

Update the LICENSE badge to point to the new repo location on GitHub.

been set to **public**.

Add additional badges for CI, docs, and other integrations as needed within the
`<p>` tag next to the LICENSE.

### Repo Description

Update the repositories description with a short summary of the repository's
intent.
Include an appropriate emoji at the start of the summary.

Add a handful of tags that summarize topics relating to the repository.
If the repo has a documentation site or webpage, add it next to the repository
description.
